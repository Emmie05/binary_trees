# Binary Trees Project

**Author: EMMANUEL FORSTER**

This project provides a collection of functions and data structures for working with binary trees, including Binary Search Trees (BSTs), AVL Trees, and Max Binary Heaps. It offers a range of operations to create, manipulate, and analyze binary trees.

## Data Structures
The project defines the following data structures for binary trees:
- `binary_tree_t`: Basic binary tree node.
- `bst_t`: Binary Search Tree node.
- `avl_t`: AVL Tree node.
- `heap_t`: Max Binary Heap node.

## Binary Tree Functions
The project includes various functions for basic binary trees, such as node insertion, deletion, and traversal. Some of the key functions are:
- `binary_tree_node`: Create a new binary tree node.
- `binary_tree_insert_left`: Insert a node as the left child.
- `binary_tree_delete`: Delete a binary tree.
- `binary_tree_inorder`: Perform an in-order traversal.

## Binary Search Tree Functions
This project supports Binary Search Trees (BSTs) and provides functions for managing them, including insertion, search, and removal. Key functions include:
- `bst_insert`: Insert a value into a BST.
- `bst_search`: Search for a value in a BST.
- `bst_remove`: Remove a value from a BST.

## AVL Tree Functions
For AVL Trees, the project offers functions for insertion and removal while maintaining AVL properties. Some of the essential functions are:
- `avl_insert`: Insert a value into an AVL tree.
- `avl_remove`: Remove a value from an AVL tree.

## Max Binary Heap Functions
Max Binary Heaps are supported, with functions for insertion, extraction, and sorting. Key functions include:
- `heap_insert`: Insert a value into a Max Binary Heap.
- `heap_extract`: Extract the root node from a Max Binary Heap.
- `heap_to_sorted_array`: Convert a Max Binary Heap to a sorted array.
